# E11a-3D
In this assignment I learned teh fundamentals of transformations which allow a 3D character to turn with the movement of a mouse and the difference between local and global position. THere was actually quite a few camera tricks in this tutorial I was unaware of before and I really enjoyed learning how to import models. I can't wait to get some awesome models or try to make some with Blender! I might ask a friend of mine to teach me how to use it.
